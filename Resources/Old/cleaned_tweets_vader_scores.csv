Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly. Model 3 orders at 180,000 in 24 hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!  Will include India-wide Supercharger network  sure!  Coming in the mail  Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).  Just order the SpaceX option package! Thanks for tuning in to the Model 3 unveil Part 1! Part 2 is super next level, but that's for later…  yes, will cover whole country  yes  sure is  X and S will also be available Adding several more countries to Model 3 order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing &amp; Ireland. Model 3 orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person Online ordering at   will now open at 7:30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at 8:30.

Awesome on every level. Meeting w design team every day. Tesla customers are v smart &amp; don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: 0.0% want it disabled -- not 0.1%, 0.0%.   It can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything &gt;= water density) detection  Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud. Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us.    That is a very good point! Btw, want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their help and support in making Autopilot better. Please direct all criticism at Tesla. Promising call today with , maker of our radar sensor. Looks like significant improvements possible via OTA software update. Have to focus on tonight's  launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.  much appreciated  Usually true. We need more sane and reasonable people making their voice heard.

Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.          Of course :)     Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023    That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.   Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.   The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy. Love and Rockets   Now, if I can just figure out how to attach those to a really big shark ...

Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced. @samuelrogg @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production. @rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ABS calibration algorithm @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production. @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car. @camgfrost @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️ @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try. @teslaology @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations. @LanceUlanoff The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this. @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address.

They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it. We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?  Good point     No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class “lords &amp; commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.     More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article …       No problem       They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.   Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!       I didn’t meet with him  I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise. Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.     Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.   Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced.    To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production.    ABS calibration algorithm   Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.   Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.    Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️   Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little   Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.    Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.  The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this.   Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers   Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.      Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar.com.    ",0.9981,0.205,0.115,0.68

Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though."," Love the space cowboy esthetic  ♥️ At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence &amp; abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all.  You’re saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language &amp; ad hominem attacks, then deleted those tweets to hide them, is a “good person”?    This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite!        “Nano” is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Would’ve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman.    Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I’m against science is like saying Beyoncé doesn’t know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue.     Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didn’t set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I don’t have the right to deny false accusations? That’s messed up.    You’ve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I’m against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don’t represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too       Great book. Read it when it came out.       Exactly  SpaceX has Area 58 at Cape Canaveral. That’s 7 better than 51.   Yeah   Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument   Which part? Love their cuisine. And the views are amazing.   Yes  There are no aliens. Officially, at least …  You have so many great pics &amp; factoids!     Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money.    I really want to make this cupholder   A dream that wd prob be a nightmare in reality. Cup holder that auto adjusted for size &amp; stiffness of cup/bottle, maintained cold or hot temp &amp; dried off water condensation. Or I cd work on getting humanity to Mars. Tough choice.  I’ve literally had dreams about cup holder designs  Noted. We can prob adjust spring force &amp; catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!    You’re welcome. Appreciate the letter.  Good school         Had a great time with my kids        Yes      Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isn’t showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by “powerful people” &amp; my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media.   Turk Thanks 😀  Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region   2020      Pointing out to aspiring journo &amp; Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by “powerful people” that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear.   Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.      You’re right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off …      Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.     You’re missing the point &amp; living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesn’t trust you. This was true *before* the last election &amp; only got worse. Don’t believe me? Run your own poll …     You’re welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming I’m against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media.     You really think I haven’t spent time in a newsroom? I’ve spent time in too many. Bleak.     Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media  Yup, deleted    ? It should   No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking &amp; will ride tire traction limit. You won’t notice sport brakes unless you’re on a racetrack &amp; have the sticky 20” tires.  Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model 3 started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks  for excellent critical feedback!  Yes, Model 3 Performance will have red calipers &amp; sport level brakes  Keyword “future” 🤣  ♥️🖤🚀🎶👻🐇🧚‍♀️💫      Will do another rev before final design  I was      That’s what I had in mind   Sometimes even I think we’re the same person!      Nanotech *is* bs imo. When you take something that has nothing to do w gender &amp; make it about that, you devalue genuine gender issues.  That’s a great song! Sometimes … when I have hurt feelings, I play this song …     No, that’s the other guy    So true 😢   USAToday FTW!  Dank is wack unless you’re on weed   Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this “non-journalist” who is also pro gasoline cars? Is this just published as counterpoint? I assume NYT does believe in climate change? But femtotech is the future …   Nanotech is so 2008. Picotech is 1000 times better. Yeah, that’s exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers.

","    Thanks, good advice   They have about three weeks before their short position explodes  Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software I’m driving.      Can’t wait for the new  season to start!  We’ve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties.  Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.     Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show.     I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America.  They started it &amp; attacked me personally Search UAW and “corruption”. Very long reading list. Great organization.       “Profit” just means you earned more money than you spent &amp; certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing &amp; extremely hard. It has taken Tesla 15 years &amp; we’re almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford &amp; Tesla has gone bankrupt.  They don’t seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon  Engels wrote 2nd &amp; 3rd volumes based on Marx’s “notes”. Less reliable.  Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware.   Wow, you know nothing &amp; are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change &amp; you couldn’t care less.    Read it. Like the green, translucent Martian opal?    Iron pyrite  Congratulations to LA Times and Patrick Soon-Shiong!    You’re just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said I’d fail &amp; be back in 3 months.  I don’t want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past.   You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That’s a very bigoted position. Well said    Then you’ll be fine      Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.     ...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate.    Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread.     More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).  How big is your short position? Just curious.     Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.  I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.    UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps.   I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too.   I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.     Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult.  Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that’s a special case.         SX 300 &amp; soon SX 500. Kind of a modern version of Inconel superalloys. High strength at temperature, extreme oxidation resistance. Needed for ~800 atmosphere, hot, oxygen-rich turbopump on Raptor rocket engine.   Structures, engines, avionics, guidance &amp; control software, new alloys, space lasers (ooh, maybe I shouldn’t have said that) …   Love you too 💕  👽🧚‍♀️🚀🍃🍄🍕🍕🍕  Fair point Auto-semiotic asphyxiation (sorry, couldn’t resist)  And I don’t trust that Engels guy. He could have made up most of 2nd &amp; 3rd volumes. Nobody actually knows.  Your math isn’t very good. Would require 61%. And what’s your issue anyway? Better suggestions are welcome. The Semi-erotics of Evil    I dare you to stop following me. Do it.  Ok The enemy of my enemy is myself      Exactly   Libertinarian  Direct democracy by the people. Laws must be short, as there is trickery in length. Automatic expiration of rules to prevent death by bureaucracy. Any rule can be removed by 40% of people to overcome inertia. Freedom.   The mind sacrificing itself in the final ship battle  All of them, especially Surface Detail If you must know, I am a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks     I disagree with that goal &amp; gave away Tesla patents to help other companies     If I’m not a communist, why do I make red cars 🚘 🤔   Very appealing if you’re a sophomore in college. It’s a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness.    That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.  lol   Read Das Kapital when I was 14, incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good.   Might actually be his! Amazing work by Tesla team. Built entire new general assembly line in 3 weeks w minimal resources. Love u guys so much! Pic of 1st Model 3 dual motor performance coming off the line …    You’re a docile puppet of the UAW. Be honest about what you are.  Yes  Sigh By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all. “No sense of humor” is certainly proving itself true. Good grief! How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb?  Answer: That’s not funny!!

All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast. @jevjack1 Can’t be too buoyant Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand.

Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work? @bonnienorman @TeslaBull @trippedover Interesting  ","  That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.   A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete  Yes. Those videos are from this morning.  According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage. Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage    Thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people.  According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages   Tube diameter is 31cm  Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation.  It is an honor to work with them With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space   Thanks  for letting us use your pool  I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz …    It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward  Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections.    Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player.   Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm.      Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.   Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it’s on a plane to Thailand  Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure.   I am an engineer       Tight control code is always C      Python is done right. Great name story too.   If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one     🖤🖤🖤 Python 🖤🖤🖤  Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.    Turbo   C  Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could’ve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue.

Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year! @MebFaber Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp!

The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return. @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators @Erdayastronaut I hope to be less wrong over time @FlintSchools @MuskFoundation You’re most welcome.

Why would they be upset about their mission? It’s what they do. Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point! Great verdict 😀    ","  Fair point 😀  When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!  Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide.    V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.  Only if they’re extremely tiny  We don’t judge. Any pic you want! Tesla owners can refer someone to buy a Tesla &amp; get any image they want laser etched in glass &amp; sent to deep space for millions of years  Rococo Basilisk is First Falcon 9 land landing mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California coming up soon!     The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam     The big funds can &amp; will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking.     Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder    Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return.    There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators  I hope to be less wrong over time   You’re most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future. What they do should be illegal The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned      Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal. By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model 3 actually outsold Camry by a factor of two             This is amazing    Almost ready.

So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.   You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear.  Pop up, park and walk!  I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St. If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety. Next step for  Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).    Precisely Presentation starting at 8:15   This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start   Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better. All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city.   Yes Tesla in  tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again   Boring product launch will be streamed live at 8pm California time tonight      Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport  Same applies to those who didn’t order PUP    ",0.995,0.164,0.037,0.799

No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps Testing Starship heatshield hex tiles         Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots      Only some of the hottest sections     Full size     We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don’t need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.    You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.  Yes, full duration     Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.      Agreed    Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.    Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout …   Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.  First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.   Goes against interests of all Texans   Wow, this is crazy  If someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day 8, that’s fine To be clear, orders are fully refundable, even after you’ve had your Tesla for a week Reminder to buy our S3XY cars before midnight on Monday! Prices rise slightly worldwide on Tuesday. You can order online at       Yes!     Definitely down the road, once construction &amp; upgrades aren’t so crazy    This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.    Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production   Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer    Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity.    Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions.   Still get this question a lot, even though Norway 🇳🇴 has highest Tesla cars per person on 🌏 (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.

Two, independent system-on-chip architecture, with each SoC having two NN accelerators that can perform simultaneous health-check calculations to protect against a soft error    Yes. Working through regulatory approvals. The Tesla Full Self-Driving Computer now in production is at about 5% compute load for these tasks or 10% with full fail-over redundancy  Time flies  Milton  Any user input counts Milton  Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change. Just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion miles/km of real-world lane changes with reliability &gt;&gt; human.  It will enable video when parked &amp; connected to WiFi. All Tesla Superchargers will have free WiFi over time.  You’re welcome. Thanks for your great photos!   Yeah, I’d love to do that Starhopper     Good idea   Definitely  Already fixed  To make core AP more affordable  That would be cool. Color variation causes havoc though. Team is working on international versions super hard btw. Unfortunately, regulators around the world have different rules &amp; processes, so just takes time. Tesla Enhanced Summon coming out in US next week for anyone with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option      Precisely   Almost done  Are you on Mad Max Mode? This may be too meek for places like the LA Freeway …    Radar   Sure   Exactly  Base AP will have same NN, so core functionality also improves  Many different regulatory authorities. Just takes time. Latest Autopilot update is epic. Rolling out to all US owners with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option. International coming soon.

Offer me money, offer me power …   Also   Without the removal fee, Tesla Solar is unequivocally a guaranteed, instant money printer, producing $300 to $1000 per year (in after tax income!) For the remainder of September, Tesla is permanently waiving the $1500 solar removal fee requirement. Note, the ability to stop monthly payments at any time remains.  Definitely for Space Force. We need to make Starfleet real.  Very exciting to see India’s rapid progress in space! There are always setbacks, of course, but I think India is doing great overall.      Yes  Thanks for offering!

So it goes   Sure looks that way   Nice 🤣🤣  Solar  Depends on total system efficiency &amp; how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so 1 to 10MW as a rough guess  Whoa, that does look good!  Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date. French fries 🍟 are the devil 😈           ., are you aware that one of your senior journalists (Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?         Super messed up situation!  Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.   Should be much better at this point Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts  Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …  Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist. Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.  When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.    Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.  😉   Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released.  Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive. Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1 Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power &amp; no more blackouts!

Yes   Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.   SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.

Starship has giant dome 🤣🤣       Haha true  muffin or not-muffin    Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship.   New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zeno’s Paradox — at any given point, you’re halfway there   Crew Dragon should be physically ready &amp; at the Cape in Feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months 8 years later, the simulation is mostly real    Amazing work by Tesla China team!! ❤️❤️  🤣🤣    Tesla app based payment will soon be rolled out WW. It’s tough making functionality work across so many regulatory domains.    Is purchasing through the Tesla app not working?   I def believe in the ethical treatment of animals &amp; taking action of climate, but these are mostly separate moral issues  Historian OwnersofMA    Nice   Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation &amp; electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isn’t critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!    Ok  I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy, but it’s true that everyone going vegan still wouldn’t stop climate change. Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere &amp; oceans is fundamentally the issue.  😎 Dam now rly want choc chip muffin  OwnersofMA    Slight tweak to the glass needed &amp; then it should be good to go OwnersofMA    What is the platonic ideal of the perfect candy? Really feels like candy R&amp;D hasn’t improved in ages. Damn candy oligarchs!! [shakes fist at sky]    Yeah, Boring Bricks 🧱 are def coming, but whole team is focused on getting Vegas Convention Center tunnel operational so people can try it out, suggest improvements, etc. I ♥️ crowdsourcing ideas with people who really care about making great products!   Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever. 😮     Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them.   Pretty much   Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.  No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is.    That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted.   For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net.  Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.   ❤️ you too sis   Sorry about this. We will do our best. The Tesla production &amp; delivery teams have been working super hard.   Literally. It was at 40th &amp; Baltimore in Philadelphia before gentrification.          Ramones &amp; Bach         I hope someone has pics! My Mom came to visit one weekend &amp; was quite surprised by it all, but helped work coat check &amp; guarded the cash with a kitchen knife 🤣🤣        To pay rent, we turned our house into a nightclub &amp; charged a $5 entry fee. Looked cool at night, but insane by day … blacklights, luminescent spray paint &amp; metal junk sculptures.  🖤 you too  Sounds like a Marxist with style   Exactly  Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone.       This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship &amp; debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton &amp; Stanford.      This person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal?      We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).  My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round would’ve happened anyway.     He didn’t own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?  Pretty much   Federal   Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals.  Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.   Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too.  Yes, but it’s too secret   Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects  No, he’s still much faster 🐌 These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them.  Done by dawn  That would be a fringe benefit 🤣🤣 Build super safe, Earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic  Flight is hopefully 2 to 3 months away  We’re now building flight design of Starship SN1, but each SN will have at least minor improvements, at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0.

Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.    Sounds about right     Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?   I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington     We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.  They were, but are they currently?    Interesting  We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty.             Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.            Sure           Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet …            SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.            That’s for sure! 😅           I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 😀            My (again) personal favorite is            Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially . Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle.           Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2.           SN26          The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!      Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch      Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.         Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage.       Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%.    Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!    Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!    Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.   Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test.  True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they’d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.    ",0.9982,0.168,0.071,0.76

You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county.    San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada.   Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.   Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected &amp; ignorant “Interim Health Officer” of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!  No, I have a license!

By picking which stories are written about &amp; how prominently they’re placed, a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative.     Klippenstein has gone full twitter troll.

It’s so much work to create our own tech. We develop new tech, because we have to, not because we want to.  Tesla Germany designed &amp; built the vaccine RNA printers for CureVac, but, subject to some CureVac IP, they could be made for other companies too  Technically, James Watt measured a pony, added 50% &amp; rounded up haha     Also, Critical Thinking   Alexander and the Rise of Hellenism and Film Studies  Wow, I super loved astronomy (but took it at Queens, not Penn)! Definitely one of my favorite classes. Senior year quantum mechanics at Penn was the hardest class I ever took. That stuff will mess with your mind.   Yeah, he sent it to me through a mutual physics prof friend at Caltech/CERN. Very basic stuff.    It’s too embarrassing Just learned that my physics prof from Penn is head of Fermilab &amp; still has some of my old homework ☺️  It is unfortunately common for many in academia to overweight the value of ideas &amp; underweight bringing them to fruition. For example, the idea of going to the moon is trivial, but going to the moon is hard.     People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone. If you have multiple pre-existing health conditions &amp; a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect.     That &amp; Giga Berlin are why I’m headed to Germany this week. Conversations with Harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed RNA printer has potential be helpful for vaccines &amp; cures in many areas.   Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low &amp; symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells      Yeah    One person at Tesla (out of 60,000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife &amp; Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was.   Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn’t blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval.           Not yet          Yes. This is the hardest part of the booster design.
