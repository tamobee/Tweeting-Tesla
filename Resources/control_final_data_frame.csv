F9 fins only work for 4 mins. We were ~10% off. Am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission. You guys rock! Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month. Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing. Didn't get good landing/impact video. Pitch dark and foggy. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces. Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced... Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard. Close, but no cigar this time. Bodes well for the future tho. Ascent phase good. Dragon deployed to Space Station rendezvous orbit.

Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells.  Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.  yes, coming this year  Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height  you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.   correct  hopefully 0.21   what's the link to that?  No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.  no problem  Will cover whole country hopefully this year  yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster  less  torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog. And, of course, it will have more cowbells. Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain.  yes   Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year    definitely   should be addressed this year  Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.  that's not the real steering system  yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.  Some tweaking underway  Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.   Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.  Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.  They can. Will be great for road trips and camping  It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally. In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome  We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.  There will be an optional tow hitch.  Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.   Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.  cool, thanks!   Yes, if the trend continues, before 276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat Model 3 design sketches    We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before 3 production starts.  They will. We spent a lot of time on those.  Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. They deserve a lot of credit.  we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines  yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity.  and a few other things Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order.  Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.

WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.   Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.

Kinda have to.  All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves  Definitely Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)  Yes Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.

How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi? @asimo3089 How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive? @trabru Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel! @oakhaller I think so @FredericLambert @JimPengelly No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S. @Trojan81 Tues/Wed @jDaz Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion @timothymjr Tues/Wed next week @Skate_a_book Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away. @JimPengelly Yes, but not until next year @AlSaibie Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars. @theKen_Miller Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot @Greg525 How about now? @varunfatehpuria Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to. @luciojr All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves @swindeez Definitely Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :) @TimBeiko Yes Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology. Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true. @macwalterslives Looking forward to playing the game with my kids! @aaronpaul_8 I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful. @nextspaceflight @inversedotcom Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien @lennart375 @inversedotcom The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one.

Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.     ♥️🦄    Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs.    Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.    Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by Reveal.  We’re working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak &amp; pinpoint origin by acoustic signature &amp; triangulation SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to  Plum Brook vacuum chamber     For sure before snowfall this year    It can tow far more than rated capacity   Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.  With production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live.     That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.    Exactly 🚀💫🎉! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.    Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union.    About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it.  Yes     Exactly    They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.  Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.  They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight.  It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell   Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.  Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now.  Good idea ...  That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine! Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions. Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.  Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time. Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track. Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range  It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing  Exactly Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.      I’m about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight  You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards     That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!  Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior.  AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in. Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.

Literally your Mom could file for NLRB. @MacTechGenius @marshall5912 @buckycovington Exactly 🚀💫🎉! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then. @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union. @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it. @AKSINGH_S Yes @KingLutron @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Exactly @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to. @paulmacguyscott Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will. @Josh_Soto They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight. @JimmyRussellExe It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell @AntVenom @zacharyj98 Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July. @Josh_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now. @zacharyj98 Good idea ... @MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine! Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions. Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph. @PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time. Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track. Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range @plot_qasc It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing @clemyeung Exactly Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork. @Everman @scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf I’m about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight @AddankiSarat You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards @scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars! @DMC_Ryan Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior. @DMC_Ryan AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in. Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.

Will request that they test current production.   Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.    Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️   Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little   Complexity is the devil.

Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.    Of course, but it’s the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; we’re never going to make them again.     Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons    Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust — literally bulletproof.   Not recommended for urban environments   Yes   The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda.   It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.  Love this design. Simpler the better.   Add an R for Roadster 👽💕🚀  Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.    A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.  Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing.  Will do   Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha.  You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another.  Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.  Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.    That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features. This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I’d know everything’s fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 🤔 Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2.   20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your 🧠 like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?€}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.  In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company’s name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony.  That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents   At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps. More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)  Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further. 19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way… SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering.

UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.

More comfortable &amp; a great view of the mountains. @maysacha @JayPrisefighter @cfarivar Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack! @JayPrisefighter @cfarivar They also poured the concrete &amp; built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it’s way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions! @joshsteimle @monongahelaEX @AntVenom No @cfarivar Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!!

Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target. @LittleMissFlint Happy to support @MabzMagz Boring Co has advanced ground penetrating radar &amp; is pretty good at digging holes. Don’t know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too smal. If so, could dropship fully charged Powerpacks and pumps. @AWatsonMenswear Belfast is beautiful @BelTel No, was just there with my kids for a few hours to see the GoT set &amp; had dinner at a pub. Love the show and GRRM’s books. @davealexhou Should be coming soon @icp I will buy tons of your merch @Cody_Walker9 Very early on, we had the ability to use the car as a battery outputting power. Maybe worth revisiting that. @antonlodder Camera &amp; onboard neural net should detect.

Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.      Good idea     Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.  You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂    Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.      Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.  It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution   Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.  I would def recommend this   Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval.

Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does. @ArkadiuszKula @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Good idea @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack. @LittleMissFlint You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying. @williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall. @jeremysliew It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution @siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large. @erikveen I would def recommend this @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA.

People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth’s gravitational reach is infinite. “Zero gravity” is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity. At SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas   Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.

It’s embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant         You def don’t want electric pumps on a rocket engine!

I’m a gamer &amp; my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.  Yup     Would love to do exactly that  Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun.     Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.      Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.      Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy.   Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers     If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map.        There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible.     No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.  Fair   Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.  Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.    Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.   Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum.

Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.  About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.   That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low   There will be no Block 6.

Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail. @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship. @baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent. @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000, as all seats would be “coach” &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands. @YusifzadaAgshin About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips. @Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low @C3LT_Games @SciGuySpace There will be no Block 6.

So it goes   Sure looks that way   Nice 🤣🤣  Solar  Depends on total system efficiency &amp; how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so 1 to 10MW as a rough guess  Whoa, that does look good!  Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date. French fries 🍟 are the devil 😈           ., are you aware that one of your senior journalists (Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?         Super messed up situation!  Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.   Should be much better at this point Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts  Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …  Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist. Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.  When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.    Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.  😉   Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released.  Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive. Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1 Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power &amp; no more blackouts!

Will be smooth as silk. @wk057 @Tesla Should be much better at this point Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts @brockm Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry … @bruce_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist. Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout. @cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car. @tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude. @wilsonlam 😉 @annerajb @Thebault_Arthur Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released. @Thebault_Arthur Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive. Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1 Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power &amp; no more blackouts!  https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9  ",0.03669348716575882,0.06579525612410952,0.0,46.0,832043.0,18979.0,95638.0,0.9946,0.161,0.045,0.794,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,1,1

Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press Excellent review by Marques! 187k @somepitch Yes @Revitalize Haha v true With no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement 146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor @cleantechnica Great analysis @GenerationPls @pewdiepie That would be cool @pewdiepie Gonna have some sick attachments @cleantechnica 🤣🤣 @carkuwu Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) Riding in the Cybertruck @SuperSaf @Tesla Sure Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch.

When moving giant body flaps rapidly, achieving high power is much harder than high torque.  Hard to believe it’s almost time to retire Cargo Dragon after a decade of solid service   Exactly  Will talk about that on Q4 call  Yeah, engineering is ~90% of my time at SpaceX &amp; about ~60% at Tesla Barrel on dome     Took me an embarrassingly long time to learn that   Sounds about right 🤣🤣   Beyond awesome. He was the real deal.  Seems so long ago  Yes  Also, I hate deeply nested classes in C++. Had to be said.  The less code, the better! 1 point for adding a line of code, but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil.  Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter &amp; more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It’s like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!     Tesla merch def needs some love, but too many fish to fry rn     Coming …   Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels &amp; domes?    We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon  Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.   Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool.  No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor    Yeah  Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020.  Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction.  We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome. Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome 🤣🤣       Haha true  muffin or not-muffin    Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship.   New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zeno’s Paradox — at any given point, you’re halfway there   Crew Dragon should be physically ready &amp; at the Cape in Feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months 8 years later, the simulation is mostly real    Amazing work by Tesla China team!! ❤️❤️  🤣🤣    Tesla app based payment will soon be rolled out WW. It’s tough making functionality work across so many regulatory domains.    Is purchasing through the Tesla app not working?   I def believe in the ethical treatment of animals &amp; taking action of climate, but these are mostly separate moral issues  Historian OwnersofMA    Nice   Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation &amp; electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isn’t critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!    Ok  I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy, but it’s true that everyone going vegan still wouldn’t stop climate change. Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere &amp; oceans is fundamentally the issue.  😎 Dam now rly want choc chip muffin  OwnersofMA    Slight tweak to the glass needed &amp; then it should be good to go OwnersofMA    What is the platonic ideal of the perfect candy? Really feels like candy R&amp;D hasn’t improved in ages. Damn candy oligarchs!! [shakes fist at sky]    Yeah, Boring Bricks 🧱 are def coming, but whole team is focused on getting Vegas Convention Center tunnel operational so people can try it out, suggest improvements, etc. I ♥️ crowdsourcing ideas with people who really care about making great products!   Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever. 😮     Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them.   Pretty much   Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.  No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is.    That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted.   For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net.  Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.   ❤️ you too sis   Sorry about this. We will do our best. The Tesla production &amp; delivery teams have been working super hard.   Literally. It was at 40th &amp; Baltimore in Philadelphia before gentrification.          Ramones &amp; Bach         I hope someone has pics! My Mom came to visit one weekend &amp; was quite surprised by it all, but helped work coat check &amp; guarded the cash with a kitchen knife 🤣🤣        To pay rent, we turned our house into a nightclub &amp; charged a $5 entry fee. Looked cool at night, but insane by day … blacklights, luminescent spray paint &amp; metal junk sculptures.  🖤 you too  Sounds like a Marxist with style   Exactly  Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone.       This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship &amp; debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton &amp; Stanford.      This person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal?      We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).  My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round would’ve happened anyway.     He didn’t own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?  Pretty much   Federal   Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals.  Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.   Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too.  Yes, but it’s too secret   Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects  No, he’s still much faster 🐌 These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them.  Done by dawn  That would be a fringe benefit 🤣🤣 Build super safe, Earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic  Flight is hopefully 2 to 3 months away  We’re now building flight design of Starship SN1, but each SN will have at least minor improvements, at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0.

My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round would’ve happened anyway. @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo He didn’t own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt.

For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too. @TheAssassin_95 Yes, but it’s too secret @teslaownersSV @Benioff Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects @flcnhvy No, he’s still much faster 🐌 These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them. @teslaownersSV Done by dawn @Salo4201 That would be a fringe benefit 🤣🤣 Build super safe, Earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic @JaneidyEve Flight is hopefully 2 to 3 months away @JaneidyEve We’re now building flight design of Starship SN1, but each SN will have at least minor improvements, at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0.

The hospitals *themselves* acknowledged receipt of ventilators.  Nice       All  Interesting  So true   Not to mention Medtronic, who makes the most advanced ventilators in the world, also affirming our help!      I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb. 🤣🤣                      . please fix this misunderstanding    Exactly  What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists “Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup. “Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo     A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.    Sounds about right     Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?   I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington     We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.  They were, but are they currently?    Interesting  We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty.             Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.            Sure           Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet …            SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.            That’s for sure! 😅           I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 😀            My (again) personal favorite is            Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially . Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle.           Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2.           SN26          The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!      Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch      Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss.

Yup. “Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable. @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter Sounds about right  https://t.co/pEPVJi56Vg @dschless @Bob_Wachter Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic? @TJShannon87 @Bob_Wachter I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington @annerajb @samoanpunch @cromas @Bob_Wachter We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released.

Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, it’s 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration …   Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I’d call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell. Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast     Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.   We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach &gt;99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day &amp; requires desooting of turbines between flights. After which they are recycled   Tesla batteries are lasting much longer than 200k miles / 320k km   Moreover, energy produced by Tesla solar deployments far exceeds energy used in our factories   Electric cars produce *much* less CO2 than fossil fuel cars, taking both electricity emission &amp; vehicle production into acount     Posting Tesla Impact Report, this time with summary points &amp; charts in my reply tweets     Haha. Will post summary.  Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage  Quite a piece!

Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, it’s 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration … @John_Gardi @SciGuySpace Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I’d call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell. Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast  https://t.co/axmInA9fZb @Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2. @Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach &gt;99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day &amp; requires desooting of turbines between flights.

Why do you think it should be a bigger story?   Greenspan is crackers, bananas, barky &amp; ten cards short of a full deck   Others will probably pass human trials first, but this machine is pretty special for generalized vaccine production.

Gets worse every year. Not our choice. Tested   There’s that too. Deaths should be broken out as died with vs died of.   Deaths continue to trend down    We’re seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives, in range of 5% to 10%. Article says testing went from 100k to 600k, which means a 6-fold increase in false positives. My guess is most cases, especially “no symptoms”, are false positives.      Yes     The news is sometimes created, but always curated. The latter is most pernicious. On any given day, there are thousands of potential stories. By picking which stories are written about &amp; how prominently they’re placed, a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative.     Klippenstein has gone full twitter troll.

Will take maybe a year or so to get really good at roundabouts worldwide. The world has a zillion weird corner cases. @Erdayastronaut This is what I meant by “4D”  https://t.co/xpX7j5SnPy @Erdayastronaut The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because it’s a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home &amp; work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks. Tesla is developing a NN training computer called Dojo to process truly vast amounts of video data. It’s a beast!

Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack? @archillect Sparta’s reply to Macedon    ",-0.017368384162645856,0.0013311247649909763,0.0,3.0,87739.0,4412.0,11190.0,-0.3818,0.08,0.111,0.81,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,1,1
