So bankrupt, you can't believe it. Important news in a few hours … Love seeing the scars of the rocket    Hopefully, actual video coming soon.

We have enough for about 1000/week right now. @zacharyj98 Good idea ... @MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine! Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions. Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph. @PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time. Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track.

UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs.    Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing?

The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; we’re never going to make them again. @Erdayastronaut @Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons @Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions.

My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda. @oheather1337 @WorldAndScience It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy. @WorldAndScience Love this design. Simpler the better. @DeeLex_MCEM @VHollywood21 Add an R for Roadster 👽💕🚀 @raptorweb Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially. @Off_thewalls @MKBHD @joerogan A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady. @VHollywood21 Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing. @MKBHD Will do @bartjehoel @djenkins6 Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha. @MKBHD You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another. @LanceUlanoff Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time. @LanceUlanoff Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric. @anandrajk @lexiheft @Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features.

After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond”         This Washington Post article seems good    As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death &amp; hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe &amp; open to all.  This doesn’t take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla.   A billion at most, so 20% max. Still basically in the nick of time from an age-of-Earth standpoint.  Humanity is not perfect, but it’s all we’ve got  Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old &amp; sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took 10% longer, it wouldn’t have happened at all.   Let’s find out. It would be amazing to encounter an alien civilization, provided it is not their invasion fleet! 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸    Good news coming soon  Yes  Yes, we are essentially a steward of life &amp; duty-bound imo to ensure its continuance  Life is good It is unknown whether we are the only civilization currently alive in the observable universe, but any chance that we are is added impetus for extending life beyond Earth This is why we must preserve the light of consciousness by becoming a spacefaring civilization &amp; extending life to other planets    So strange    Critical autonomous safety features like emergency braking are standard, but convenience features like active cruise control are not   It’s a tough call. Reality is that it will be pretty easy to bully a self-driving car, as it will always yield. Will prob have a manual override that requires continuous press for hardcore lane changes.  We considered going beyond Mad Max to “LA Freeway” level, but that’s too loco It’s real      Thanks!

You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos          Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.    Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.   We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done         Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ☺️High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.        That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.    Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.   Don’t know  SpaceX commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years.      Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.     SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.  So true 🤡 John Clarke 👌   Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner   Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification  That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don’t have any crypto holdings.  I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1. Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes.

Yes, full duration     Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.      Agreed    Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.    Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout …   Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.  First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.   Goes against interests of all Texans   Wow, this is crazy  If someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day 8, that’s fine To be clear, orders are fully refundable, even after you’ve had your Tesla for a week Reminder to buy our S3XY cars before midnight on Monday! Prices rise slightly worldwide on Tuesday. You can order online at       Yes!     Definitely down the road, once construction &amp; upgrades aren’t so crazy    This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.    Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production   Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer    Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity.    Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions.   Still get this question a lot, even though Norway 🇳🇴 has highest Tesla cars per person on 🌏 (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.

Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.     You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.    That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent.   ~1000, as all seats would be “coach” &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.  About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.   That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low   There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.   Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.  Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.

Starship, which aspires to be fully &amp; immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly 🥜🚀. Even though I’m immersed in Starship/Raptor design &amp; build 7 days/week, it still doesn’t feel real.    Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B  Powerwall doesn’t need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla &amp; non-Tesla solar panels   Yes   Between $100B and $10T  Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there  For sure  Yup  Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals.

You rock!! ♥️♥️  Wise words from Gary the Bot However, we won’t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense. Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at       Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.    Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.    That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it    At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.   The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.     Agreed    Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.   There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.  Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.   Hopefully, next year  Personally, I think the universe looks great for 12 billion years, let alone 13.8  Sagan was awesome  They used to have butt bellows for blowing smoke up your … along the Thames River in London    Haha exactly!

Yes  That’s the goal  Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync  Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at &gt;100 tons/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary    That’s about right  Reaction to Cyberpunk 2077 slipping release date to September   What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity.   Densification isn’t needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed  Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy.  Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!

Probably this summer    Yeah, it looks like a medieval torture device, but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! Not hard to be way better.  PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test.   The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks.  Sorry!  A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI &amp; ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what’s truly hard). Don’t care if you even graduated high school.  Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon. We are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team, based in both Palo Alto &amp; Austin Dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data &amp; efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory &amp; ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later. Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with “At Tesla, using AI to solve self-driving isn’t just icing on the cake, it the cake” -    Join AI at Tesla! It reports directly to me &amp; we meet/email/text almost every day. My actions, not just words, show how critically I view (benign) AI.      Unfortunately, this is true. It doesn’t matter how skilled you are if you’re trapped in a giant bureaucracy.    Desperate times call for desperate measures …  Only 66 years from first controlled, powered flight to landing on the moon. Now, half a century later, we are still unable to return. This must change.    Haha true   The safest place to hide a dead body is the second page of Google search results!   Trolls/bots just need to be deemphasized relative to probable real people who aren’t being paid to push an agenda or scam. Google still shows bs/scam pages, they’re just several clicks away.   This was a huge problem for search engines until Google applied the citation relevance principle aka PageRank, among many other things     Report as soon as you see it. Troll/bot networks on Twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse &amp; ripping people off. Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement.  The crypto scam level on Twitter is reaching new levels. This is not cool.

","   Coming soon    Yes, this is a high priority     Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance, it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching 100%   Pain can certainly be turned off, but we’re not sure what the best initial test case (max goodness for least risk to patient) would be quite yet    Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car    That’s harder than it sounds. Will check with team.   Ok  !      No, but it’s mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)   It’s not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal.  To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs.      Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)     Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars     Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.    🤣🤣     That’s pretty much what happened.

Absolutely    Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results &amp; latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible. Wow, this is extremely important!!  🤣   Autopilot prime directive is: don’t crash. What seems fast to humans is slow to a computer. 360 degree low light vision &amp; sonar, plus forward radar enable to be superhuman. Upcoming software upgrades will increasingly show the potential.

This might sting a little …  The “early investor” part of Tesla is wrong. That bs has been pushed by Eberhard (worst person I’ve ever worked with and that’s saying something!) for years.  Also, there could be long period comets that intersect Earth right now. We just haven’t observed them during humanity’s (very short) recorded history.

Very real possibility  ☺️  🤣🤣 Please trash me on Wikipedia, I’m begging you History is written by the victors … except on Wikipedia haha   Cover of Barbie Girl  Yes. Probably more accurate to say Great Filters plural.   Yes, it’s called Cyber Girl We must pass The Great Filter Sounds right      Seriously  Crysis rocks A truly useful exaflop at de facto FP32   Metal has a fudge-like consistency near its melting point, so you can just smoosh it together  This is how we make Falcon 9      This is out of our hands, so hard to predict. Maybe on order of 10 billion km of real world driving will be enough to convince regulators.  Yes   🤣🤣 hasty govt 🤣🤣      A lot of work remains. Technically, we have it working in sim with FPGAs at ~0.01% capability. This will be a true supercomputer.     Dojo is still being built. Maybe a year or so from V1.0.    Autopilot was trapped in a local maximum, labeling single camera images uncorrelated in time. Now, it is not.    Your insights over the years have been excellent. That’s approximately right.  Absolutely, but it doesn’t seem that govt can move fast enough  Ok  It will blow ur mind haha   Our main engineering locations are Palo Alto, Austin &amp; Seattle, but working remotely is acceptable for exceptional candidates  I want to do electric vtol supersonic sooo bad, but my brain will overload  Asteroid impact risk is well understood, but not comets. Those worry me. Great mission patch design!   Exactly    Also definitely coming haha. Will only be on relatively recent cars, as we didn’t have an outside speaker until about a year ago. Can change inside sound easily.    Sorry, this is embarrassingly late. Two factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now.   Yes!

Wow  Uh ok, here we go … rati I don’t think this is accurate        Yeah, there are literally &gt;1000% more cameras than 10 years ago, but still zero clear photos   🤣🤣       I have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting Earth. Fuzzy pics that are worse than a 7/11 security cam frame grab don’t count!  We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It’s not a question of money. If there was a “great engineer” factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build.  Definitely  Exactly. He plays the “poor inventor” card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.  There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard’s problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze’ev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO.  When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. That says it all.  Even if half that amount, it’s still a big deal!  Interesting             SpaceX/Tesla metallurgy &amp; new materials team is next-level   Probably  I have that exact art on the wall of the place I stay in Boca Chica!   Yes, failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). Herd immunity for vast majority of people &amp; quarantine vulnerable was right though imo.  Sweden was right              There are sensitive elements, but they’re on the inside. Also, a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what I’ve posted. And yeah, anyone who can reverse engineer what I’ve posted doesn’t need to reverse engineer! rati Great work by SpaceX valve engineering &amp; production!         Our tiles are mechanically attached          It might be used in some areas. ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.         Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.  Compilers need to improve imo. Most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user.

Are such large transactions even possible? ♥️ i love all u crazy ppl out there ♥️  You have a point (sigh)  Great game  Pretty much. The main value of college used to be hanging out, having pseudo intellectual conversations &amp; partying with people your own age. Now, even that’s gone. Come for the comments,  stay for the memes💄  Absolutely. We will release FSD subscription early next year. One word: Doge Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money  Great nails &amp; lipstick           Nice    Sounds about right “Lord” Edge   Nice branding Just kidding, who needs a safe word anyway!?
