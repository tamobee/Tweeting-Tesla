Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases. Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide. Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad.

These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here. Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason. My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine. @JessicaTetreau important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide @shanenickerson Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car. Autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning! Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)  ",12.0,8653.0,677.0,3781.0,0.9824,0.156,0.042,0.802,0.0,,,,,1

If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h. Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed. @mbhnyc steel collet Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing.  https://t.co/w007TccANJ @Uncle_Gus probably However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing. Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating. Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines. Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations. Maybe some debris ingestion.

Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high. @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not. @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed.

Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom. Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0. The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors @MarekCyzio Exactly First, it’s important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while  https://t.co/srEp1tf6ZU Please ignore this thread unless you’re interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock @Ataraxia_Invest @MKBHD @HyperChangeTV They were neither valid nor pertinent.

Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions. Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph. @PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time. Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track. Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range @plot_qasc It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing @clemyeung Exactly Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork. @Everman @scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf I’m about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight @AddankiSarat You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards @scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars! @DMC_Ryan Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior. @DMC_Ryan AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in.

Maybe. Let’s hold a vote &amp; find out. @speea @AlterViggo @juliacarriew In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it.

Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise. Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you. @rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert @Tesla Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars. @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced. @samuelrogg @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production. @rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ABS calibration algorithm @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production. @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car. @camgfrost @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️ @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try. @teslaology @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations. @LanceUlanoff The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this. @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update. @reveal @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA @Al_Letson Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist.

Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again. @andyjayhawk Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more.

This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially. @Off_thewalls @MKBHD @joerogan A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady. @VHollywood21 Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing. @MKBHD Will do @bartjehoel @djenkins6 Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha. @MKBHD You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another. @LanceUlanoff Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time. @LanceUlanoff Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric. @anandrajk @lexiheft @Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features. This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I’d know everything’s fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 🤔 Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites.

Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company’s name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony. @FredericLambert That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents  https://t.co/HPK5R5UMS6 At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps. More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP) @djenkins6 Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further. 19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way… SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car.

Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most. @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate. @doctorow @dimas_______ @Robotbeat Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread. @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading). @TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious. @BobbieBees @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant. @doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right. @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps. @TheSithSeth @doctorow I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too. @Robotbeat @doctorow I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people. @AntVenom @Shaynooooo @kausthav_ray @SpaceX Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult. @doctorow Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books.

Nice work @sal19 &amp; @Reuters. @aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number? @aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target. @LittleMissFlint Happy to support @MabzMagz Boring Co has advanced ground penetrating radar &amp; is pretty good at digging holes.

What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed. @JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person. @JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit. @chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power. @chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction) @ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections. @JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole. @cate_long @lopezlinette Exactly.

Extremely important metric. @martinengwicht @BlondesE A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car @LanceUlanoff Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side @LanceUlanoff Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details @MartenBenjamin @NHTSAgov @Tesla Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much. @Cardoso @NHTSAgov Haha true .@NHTSAgov will post final safety probability stats soon.

Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year! @MebFaber Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp!

The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return. @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators @Erdayastronaut I hope to be less wrong over time @FlintSchools @MuskFoundation You’re most welcome.

If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:  https://t.co/FZVNlGWYgA And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements. There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc  https://t.co/lmD3ZNFR9M Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days!

Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years.  https://t.co/sqAYCCcJtd @martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species. @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine.

All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput. Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%.

Maybe there’s a good reason that isn’t obvious. Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned? Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question. Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late.

Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances. @Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining.

Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all. @Model3Owners Looking into this.

We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn. @Kalzsom @Erdayastronaut For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure. @Erdayastronaut Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2 @Erdayastronaut Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg. @Erdayastronaut Stability is not an issue with 3 @SpaceXFan97 Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom. @SpaceXFan97 Yes.

No input required at all. @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone’s on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases! @JeremyGreenlee @mobiledavidd Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations.

Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels &amp; domes? @Kristennetten @SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon @Erdayastronaut Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important. @SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool. @Erdayastronaut No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor @teslaownersSV @TonyCrisostomo @Erdayastronaut Yeah @Erdayastronaut Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020. @Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction. @DJSnM We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome. Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it!

The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever. 😮  https://t.co/JejV2rBFrf @JonAttenborough @cFidd Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them. @ollie_turrell @cFidd Pretty much @Snipergen @Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version. @cFidd No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is. @RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted. @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well.

Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone. @Joe__Wakefield @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver.

Whats their deal? @IrinaAntony @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).  My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round would’ve happened anyway. @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo He didn’t own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day.

For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too. @TheAssassin_95 Yes, but it’s too secret @teslaownersSV @Benioff Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects @flcnhvy No, he’s still much faster 🐌 These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them. @teslaownersSV Done by dawn @Salo4201 That would be a fringe benefit 🤣🤣 Build super safe, Earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic @JaneidyEve Flight is hopefully 2 to 3 months away @JaneidyEve We’re now building flight design of Starship SN1, but each SN will have at least minor improvements, at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0.

Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships. @Teslarati @13ericralph31 Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter. @nextspaceflight @chraveesh @Teslarati No, they’re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time. @chraveesh @Teslarati Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area @Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume. @Teslarati This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.

Super appreciated! @davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!! @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing. @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test. @SciGuySpace True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they’d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.    ",47.0,539758.0,15307.0,66361.0,0.9982,0.168,0.071,0.76,0.0,,,,,1

Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one. @teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product @ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough. @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term. @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy. @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three. @EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it’s fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly. @skorusARK Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate. @WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part. @WholeMarsBlog We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage @WholeMarsBlog Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system.   Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk.
