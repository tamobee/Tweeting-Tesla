2019-11-07 19:52:47,"@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."
2019-11-07 19:41:31,"@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn‚Äôt consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"

2019-11-07 19:14:14,"@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It‚Äôs also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."

2019-11-07 16:15:16,@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
2019-11-07 16:07:05,@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what‚Äôs hard.
2019-11-07 16:03:50,"@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
2019-11-07 16:01:35,"@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that‚Äôs a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
2019-11-07 15:57:54,"@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it‚Äôs designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"

2019-09-14 15:54:31,"However, we won‚Äôt customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense."
2019-09-14 15:51:09,Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at  https://t.co/sCkn87vMa9.
2019-09-14 15:33:39,"@TeslaForLife @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Exactly! We‚Äôve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide."
2019-09-14 13:59:08,"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don‚Äôt raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
2019-09-14 13:53:24,"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That‚Äôs not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I‚Äôm looking into it"
2019-09-14 13:51:01,"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
2019-09-14 13:45:58,"@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."

2019-09-14 13:03:08,"@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren‚Äôt really meant to be ‚ÄúTesla incentives‚Äù, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
2019-09-14 12:56:24,"@Model3Owners Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."

2018-12-19 14:39:37,"@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
2018-12-19 14:36:27,"@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
2018-12-19 14:34:07,"@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
2018-12-19 14:31:55,"@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they‚Äôre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
2018-12-19 14:27:44,"@FredericLambert @boringcompany You‚Äôre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn‚Äôt include it. We‚Äôre working on one that makes things clear."

2018-07-06 03:42:41,@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
2018-07-06 03:36:44,"@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
2018-07-06 02:13:44,"@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work.

2018-07-06 01:29:45,@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.

2018-05-14 16:57:33,What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.

2018-05-04 08:04:51,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms.

2018-02-12 11:30:41,"@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."

2016-01-17 15:13:58,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
2016-01-17 15:06:21,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
2016-01-15 20:47:15,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.

2013-05-03 15:00:21,Tesla raises Model S resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry  http://t.co/l5LOXtyP33
2013-05-03 14:55:36,@yatpay Side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)
2013-05-03 14:52:58,"@pataneous We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway."
2013-05-03 14:50:54,"@2552nsf Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform."
2013-05-03 14:24:48,"@rebel_sal Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better."
2013-05-03 12:55:22,"@Alan_Nestos The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy"
2013-05-03 04:43:12,@darma_setia More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
2013-05-03 04:41:24,@JSONberland We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.
2013-05-02 16:19:40,@BigBalli High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All 4 legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than Model S.
2013-05-02 16:17:29,"F9R (pronounced F-niner) shows a little leg. Design is a nested, telescoping piston w A frame.  http://t.co/H49TSS2CYl"
2013-05-02 14:01:42,@roulezelectric This is about getting a prior announcement right. Not part 4 yet.
2013-05-02 13:54:50,Time to up the ante (and fix some mistakes). Tesla announcement tomorrow.
2013-05-01 21:12:05,"@astrostephenson We're aiming for late 2015, but NASA needs to have overlapping capability to be safe. Would do the same"
2013-05-01 21:08:07,@MelissaMontoyaO Anne's role is launch site engineering. Don't think she has anything against media -- just not her role.
2013-05-01 13:44:55,@realbhuwan @teslamotors Cool :)
2013-05-01 13:03:29,@rebel_sal Just read it. Good piece.

2013-04-25 21:25:30,"@tcmeggs Am for good public transit in LA, but the pace of that construction makes the 405 look fast."
2013-04-25 21:21:08,@tcmeggs This argument is a bit silly. A city will not grow to infinite size just because there isn't traffic.
2013-04-25 14:46:28,"@NycomWireless @TeslaMotors Cool, thanks for buying our car!"
2013-04-25 14:45:45,"@Tapp697 Thanks, important clarification. Tesla announcements are always about making product experience better. Market follows eventually."

2013-04-23 22:16:21,@Trekker56 @TeslaMotors Please contact DMV Commissioner and Governor. This is not good for the people of Virginia.
2013-04-23 18:42:03,"Not all good news. Virginia DMV Commissioner just denied Tesla a dealer license, despite Hearing Officer being in favor."
