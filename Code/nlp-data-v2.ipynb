       "2657    The rate-limiting part or process in cell production is constantly changing   Cars &amp; trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases &amp; particulate, but  road tunnels under Miami would solve traffic &amp; be an example to the world.   Spoke with  about tunnels last week. If Governor &amp; Mayor want this done, we will do it.    With our giant casting machines, we are literally trying to make full-size cars in the same way that toy cars are made   Tegmark is an exceptionally smart &amp; good human  The best manufacturing technology is in ultra high volume industries, like food &amp; beverage, some medical (eg syringes) &amp; toys Battery cell production is the fundamental rate-limiter slowing down a sustainable energy future. Very important problem.  Looking into this. No question that FSD should be viewed as reasonably valuable when doing a trade-in.   For sure  Glad you’re ok  Congratulations!  This is a good one  I whistle    Cybertruck doesn’t need a garage   It will be awesome  Good point  Your server-side code is doing too much  Happy birthday Wikipedia! So glad you exist.

       "2021-01-19   @kellyreid The rate-limiting part or process in cell production is constantly changing @FrancisSuarez @CityofMiami Cars &amp; trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases &amp; particulate, but @boringcompany road tunnels under Miami would solve traffic &amp; be an example to the world.   Spoke with @RonDeSantisFL about tunnels last week. If Governor &amp; Mayor want this done, we will do it. @RationalEtienne @OwenSparks_ @Tesla With our giant casting machines, we are literally trying to make full-size cars in the same way that toy cars are made @lexfridman @tegmark Tegmark is an exceptionally smart &amp; good human @OwenSparks_ The best manufacturing technology is in ultra high volume industries, like food &amp; beverage, some medical (eg syringes) &amp; toys Battery cell production is the fundamental rate-limiter slowing down a sustainable energy future. Very important problem. @p_ferragu Looking into this. No question that FSD should be viewed as reasonably valuable when doing a trade-in. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut For sure @Erdayastronaut Glad you’re ok @Virgin_Orbit Congratulations! @teslaownersSV This is a good one @MrBeastYT I whistle @DMC_Ryan @C_R_H_M @Tesla Cybertruck doesn’t need a garage @DMC_Ryan @Tesla It will be awesome @owenshift Good point @signalapp Your server-side code is doing too much @Wikipedia Happy birthday Wikipedia!

Spoke with  about tunnels last week. If Governor &amp; Mayor want this done, we will do it.
