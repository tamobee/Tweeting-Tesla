       "2652  @archillect Once in a while, something happens that is even better than we imagined @skorusARK The factory is the product @AustinTeslaClub @TheBabylonBee Probably commenting on @signalapp will do more @PPathole I bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for $20. They‚Äôre great places to get spare parts. @TheBabylonBee A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech @alexandersibert @signalapp Already donated to Signal a year ago. Will donate more. @benmezrich I am primarily trying to advance two causes: sustainable energy &amp; extending life/consciousness beyond Earth. There is also the existential threat of AI, which we should aspire to mitigate. This doesn‚Äôt leave time to write books. @Ragazaga5 @SpacePadreIsle Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year @SpacePadreIsle The Prancing Pony? @BoredElonMusk ü§£ü§£ @song_wooseok @GerberKawasaki @benmezrich ü§£ü§£ @erigganewmoney üò¢ @mayemusk It‚Äôs true @glenn22x @woketopiansa Yes, but not for long @woketopiansa Yeah, they seemed optimistic too My 14-year-old son, Saxon, said he feels like 2021 will be a good year. I agree. Let us all make it so. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar. @Christo49699922 @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That too @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Catapult high into the air &amp; land on the roof with a base jumping parachute (the only way to travel) @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That‚Äôs actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory @techreview And increase fun! Hopefully. @benmezrich Me neither @TonyChoMrMagic @TeslaEnergy One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations @91demigod No, but maybe one day @PPathole @engineers_feed Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits. @engineers_feed His sick beats  https://t.co/8PbsgffzRp @flcnhvy Probably less than a few dozen primary decision-makers. Technically, only three.     \n",

They‚Äôre great places to get spare parts.  A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech   Already donated to Signal a year ago. Will donate more.  I am primarily trying to advance two causes: sustainable energy &amp; extending life/consciousness beyond Earth. There is also the existential threat of AI, which we should aspire to mitigate. This doesn‚Äôt leave time to write books.

When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar.     That too    Catapult high into the air &amp; land on the roof with a base jumping parachute (the only way to travel)   That‚Äôs actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory  And increase fun! Hopefully.  Me neither   One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations  No, but maybe one day   Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits.

       "2021-01-11  @archillect Once in a while, something happens that is even better than we imagined @skorusARK The factory is the product @AustinTeslaClub @TheBabylonBee Probably commenting on @signalapp will do more @PPathole I bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for $20. They‚Äôre great places to get spare parts. @TheBabylonBee A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech @alexandersibert @signalapp Already donated to Signal a year ago. Will donate more. @benmezrich I am primarily trying to advance two causes: sustainable energy &amp; extending life/consciousness beyond Earth. There is also the existential threat of AI, which we should aspire to mitigate. This doesn‚Äôt leave time to write books. @Ragazaga5 @SpacePadreIsle Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year @SpacePadreIsle The Prancing Pony? @BoredElonMusk ü§£ü§£ @song_wooseok @GerberKawasaki @benmezrich ü§£ü§£ @erigganewmoney üò¢ @mayemusk It‚Äôs true @glenn22x @woketopiansa Yes, but not for long @woketopiansa Yeah, they seemed optimistic too My 14-year-old son, Saxon, said he feels like 2021 will be a good year. I agree. Let us all make it so. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar. @Christo49699922 @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That too @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Catapult high into the air &amp; land on the roof with a base jumping parachute (the only way to travel) @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That‚Äôs actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory @techreview And increase fun! Hopefully. @benmezrich Me neither @TonyChoMrMagic @TeslaEnergy One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations @91demigod No, but maybe one day @PPathole @engineers_feed Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits. @engineers_feed His sick beats  https://t.co/8PbsgffzRp @flcnhvy Probably less than a few dozen primary decision-makers. Technically, only three.     \n",

       "2021-01-11   Once in a while, something happens that is even better than we imagined  The factory is the product   Probably commenting on  will do more  I bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for $20. They‚Äôre great places to get spare parts.  A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech   Already donated to Signal a year ago. Will donate more.  I am primarily trying to advance two causes: sustainable energy &amp; extending life/consciousness beyond Earth. There is also the existential threat of AI, which we should aspire to mitigate. This doesn‚Äôt leave time to write books.   Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year  The Prancing Pony?  ü§£ü§£    ü§£ü§£  üò¢  It‚Äôs true   Yes, but not for long  Yeah, they seemed optimistic too My 14-year-old son, Saxon, said he feels like 2021 will be a good year. I agree. Let us all make it so.   Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time   I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar.     That too    Catapult high into the air &amp; land on the roof with a base jumping parachute (the only way to travel)   That‚Äôs actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory  And increase fun! Hopefully.  Me neither   One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations  No, but maybe one day   Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits.

       "2021-01-11  @archillect Once in a while, something happens that is even better than we imagined @skorusARK The factory is the product @AustinTeslaClub @TheBabylonBee Probably commenting on @signalapp will do more @PPathole I bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for $20. They‚Äôre great places to get spare parts. @TheBabylonBee A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech @alexandersibert @signalapp Already donated to Signal a year ago. Will donate more. @benmezrich I am primarily trying to advance two causes: sustainable energy &amp; extending life/consciousness beyond Earth. There is also the existential threat of AI, which we should aspire to mitigate. This doesn‚Äôt leave time to write books. @Ragazaga5 @SpacePadreIsle Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year @SpacePadreIsle The Prancing Pony? @BoredElonMusk ü§£ü§£ @song_wooseok @GerberKawasaki @benmezrich ü§£ü§£ @erigganewmoney üò¢ @mayemusk It‚Äôs true @glenn22x @woketopiansa Yes, but not for long @woketopiansa Yeah, they seemed optimistic too My 14-year-old son, Saxon, said he feels like 2021 will be a good year. I agree. Let us all make it so. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar. @Christo49699922 @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That too @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Catapult high into the air &amp; land on the roof with a base jumping parachute (the only way to travel) @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That‚Äôs actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory @techreview And increase fun! Hopefully. @benmezrich Me neither @TonyChoMrMagic @TeslaEnergy One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations @91demigod No, but maybe one day @PPathole @engineers_feed Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O.

Needs to be a few hours at most. @PPathole @johnkrausphotos @SpaceX Two of the engines need slight repairs, so will be switched out @johnkrausphotos @SpaceX Nice shot @realOmarAbdalah We don‚Äôt have high school internships, but please apply when you‚Äôre in college!       \n",

       "2021-01-11   Once in a while, something happens that is even better than we imagined  The factory is the product   Probably commenting on  will do more  I bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for $20. They‚Äôre great places to get spare parts.  A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech   Already donated to Signal a year ago. Will donate more.  I am primarily trying to advance two causes: sustainable energy &amp; extending life/consciousness beyond Earth. There is also the existential threat of AI, which we should aspire to mitigate. This doesn‚Äôt leave time to write books.   Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year  The Prancing Pony?  ü§£ü§£    ü§£ü§£  üò¢  It‚Äôs true   Yes, but not for long  Yeah, they seemed optimistic too My 14-year-old son, Saxon, said he feels like 2021 will be a good year. I agree. Let us all make it so.   Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time   I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar.     That too    Catapult high into the air &amp; land on the roof with a base jumping parachute (the only way to travel)   That‚Äôs actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory  And increase fun! Hopefully.  Me neither   One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations  No, but maybe one day   Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits.

       "2021-01-11  @archillect Once in a while, something happens that is even better than we imagined @skorusARK The factory is the product @AustinTeslaClub @TheBabylonBee Probably commenting on @signalapp will do more @PPathole I bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for $20. They‚Äôre great places to get spare parts. @TheBabylonBee A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech @alexandersibert @signalapp Already donated to Signal a year ago. Will donate more. @benmezrich I am primarily trying to advance two causes: sustainable energy &amp; extending life/consciousness beyond Earth. There is also the existential threat of AI, which we should aspire to mitigate. This doesn‚Äôt leave time to write books. @Ragazaga5 @SpacePadreIsle Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year @SpacePadreIsle The Prancing Pony? @BoredElonMusk ü§£ü§£ @song_wooseok @GerberKawasaki @benmezrich ü§£ü§£ @erigganewmoney üò¢ @mayemusk It‚Äôs true @glenn22x @woketopiansa Yes, but not for long @woketopiansa Yeah, they seemed optimistic too My 14-year-old son, Saxon, said he feels like 2021 will be a good year. I agree. Let us all make it so. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar. @Christo49699922 @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That too @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Catapult high into the air &amp; land on the roof with a base jumping parachute (the only way to travel) @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That‚Äôs actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory @techreview And increase fun! Hopefully. @benmezrich Me neither @TonyChoMrMagic @TeslaEnergy One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations @91demigod No, but maybe one day @PPathole @engineers_feed Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits. @engineers_feed His sick beats  https://t.co/8PbsgffzRp @flcnhvy Probably less than a few dozen primary decision-makers. Technically, only three.     \n",

       "2021-01-11   Once in a while, something happens that is even better than we imagined  The factory is the product   Probably commenting on  will do more  I bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for $20. They‚Äôre great places to get spare parts.  A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech   Already donated to Signal a year ago. Will donate more.  I am primarily trying to advance two causes: sustainable energy &amp; extending life/consciousness beyond Earth. There is also the existential threat of AI, which we should aspire to mitigate. This doesn‚Äôt leave time to write books.   Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year  The Prancing Pony?  ü§£ü§£    ü§£ü§£  üò¢  It‚Äôs true   Yes, but not for long  Yeah, they seemed optimistic too My 14-year-old son, Saxon, said he feels like 2021 will be a good year. I agree. Let us all make it so.   Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time   I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar.     That too    Catapult high into the air &amp; land on the roof with a base jumping parachute (the only way to travel)   That‚Äôs actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory  And increase fun! Hopefully.  Me neither   One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations  No, but maybe one day   Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits.
